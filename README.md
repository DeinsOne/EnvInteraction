# EnvInteraction
Cross platform c++ library for interaction with window environment. Window capturing and event sending in real time

## Goal
Goal of this project is to build easy emendable cross platform library to interact with graphical interface from c++.

 - [x] Window capturing
    - [x] Linux window capturing
    - [x] Windows window capturing
 - [x] Recovering images to disk
    - [x] Programmable limitation
    - [x] Multithreading
 - [ ] Inputs
    - [ ] Mouse buttons
    - [ ] Mouse movement
    - [ ] Keyboard events

Potentially this project will be used in computer vision one to interact with real time frame changing and immediately reacting to this

## Requirement

## Build
